# IMDb TV Series Reviews Visualization

## Motivation

This project was an assignment for the NUS module "Essential Data Analytics Tools: Data Visualisation" where any dataset could be chosen from the Tidy Tuesday project and visualized as I saw fit.

## Methodology

This assignment was written in R Markdown, using libraries such as dplyr and ggplot2.
